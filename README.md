## II) Historic Plot proposal


Intro:
You're Merovech, the youngest son of the Frankish king Chlodio the Longhair. You start off in Ravenna in 450, where you're a Frankish envoy to Rome but really just a glorified hostage handed over by your dad after he got rekt by the great Aetius in 448. There you meet the main Roman protagonists, witness all the court intrigue that leads up to Attila's invasion. By the time you hear the news of your father's death, you already know Attila is coming.

First Act:
Surprisingly Aetius calls you to Northern Gaul. You make the voyage, and once there he asks you to become king of the Franks. With his help, you must prove yourself to the Franks and supplant your elder brother(s).

Second Act:
You're king of the Franks, but Attila has just crossed the Rhine, and the Frankish settlements are helpless against his horde as is the rest of Northern Gaul. Might have to diminish the role played by Aetius here a little if we want Merovech to be the hero, so he could be too old or forced back to Ravenna by Valentinian (maybe change the chronology a little and have Valentinian murder him now), forcing Merovech to take charge, or perhaps they agreed Merovech would be the best bridge between Romans and Germanics. Either way, he travels across Gaul to forge an alliance with Burgundians, Alans, Saxons, Armorican Celts, and Visigoths (those would have to be the hardest, they're the most dangerous enemies past and future), maybe others too like Vandals (who would have to be total assholes). All the while Attila sacks city after city and you lose more and more of your home map. With your alliance ready, you optionally help in whatever magic happened with Genevieve in Paris, leading the Huns right where you want them East of OrlÃ©ans. Battle, and victory or defeat depending on previous quest outcomes.

Third Act:
Attila is defeated but alive, and marches to Italy. But your alliance disbands as Gaul is no longer threatened, and your forces are no longer enough to defeat him in battle again, so if you want to stop him from conquering Italy you must find another way to kill him.

## VII) FAQ

* 1. Are there various key locations you need to reach to secure the alliances?

Yes: Paris, Brittany, Rome, western Germany/eastern Gaul and south west of Gaul
 
* 2. On the way between each of them there are various hazards (wandering bandits?)

Yes, bandits and even whole tribes/ armies of hostile people who will later on side completely with the Huns.
 
* 3. Perhaps the NPCs will require something to convince them to go along with the alliance,

Yes, usually, money, reputations, sometimes politics as in we will have to help some people by doing their quests and being helpful in dialogues.
 
* 4. Is there some opposing force?

Yes, the opposing force is pretty strong. Attila has never been defeated before the end of the game, history wise. And he has strong allies.
 
* 5. what characters can we expect to see in the game?

"Good" Characters: Aetius, Merovech, Theodoric
 
"Evil" Characters: Attila
 
* 6. what is interesting about the time setting?

What's really interesting about the time is the interplay of different worlds. There's the world of Greco-Roman pagan religion, highly civilised but decadent. There's the barbaric pagan beliefs of Germanics, Celts, or Huns. Then there's the world of the new Eastern religions, not just Christianity but also Zoroastrianism, Talmudic Judaism, Manichaeism, Monophysitism, the cult of Isis, the cult of Cybele, the cult of the Emperor, Sol Invictus... which are all rivals but all share the same world view, a strong sense of good and evil as two battling forces, with a single God representing good, and above all a sense of impending doom, an apocalypse that will wash away the evil decadent world and allow the kingdom of God to be born. This is the feeling that most people shared, the question was which of the gods would triumph. But the cool thing is that it turned out to be literally true, the end of the old world really did happen, so reality and myth correspond really well.
 
* 7. What combat system will be used?

This will be detailed in the game design but an interesting opportunity might be to use the D&D D20 system which is licensed under the Open Gaming License.

* 8. Are the Huns really less civilized?

There should definitely be an option to consider the steppe ways superior to the "civilized" ways. There is no reason why the Mongols/Huns should be stupid Barbarians that only rape and pillage while Romans are super civilized, educated intelligent men. The reality was simply different - for example, tribal leaders could try to teach you about tengri stuff or why they think life in a city is wrong for humanity, what you get by allying/aligning with them (stability, loyality, order - just like the Mongols provided after they conquered) that kinda stuff.

* 9. How different are the three big civilizations?

The game is centered around three conflicting civilizations that are totally differnt.

The first one are the Old Romans - they are imperialistic, militarist slavers and elitists. They want to bring Rome back to the days of Cassar in which Rome's purpose was for wars to be fought for glory and fame and make one's own patrician family as famous and successful as possbile.

Then we have new Rome, which is the Christian/Byzantine Rome. This Rome is more focuesd on building churches, on providing more welfare for its citizens, abandoning the old slaver and imperialistic ways. Of course, this has the disadvantage of being threatened by foreign tribes.

Third civilization are the tribals, the Mongols, the nomads. They frown upon settling upon lands, they don't believe in cities, in settlements. They beleive in discipline, loyality, you-cratch-my-back-I-cratch-yours types of transactions between tribes, they hate Rule of Law and don't understand it, they prefer the rule of the strong and honoring their superiors and elders.
